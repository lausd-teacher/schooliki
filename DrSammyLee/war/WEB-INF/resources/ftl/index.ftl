                Caching comes via App Engine's memcached service.</p>

               specifically the method annotations, work with Guice. Otherwise
               Shiro configuration is done with the Shiro ini file.</p>

            <p>You can sign in from the link at the top right.  There is a built-in account you
               can user, <code>zenith@acme.com</code>.
                It has password <code>pass</code>.  The <code>zenith</code> account is a normal user account.</p>
            <p>You can also register for an account.  You need to provide an Email which you control for this
               as a registration code will be sent to this Email address.  Once you're registered you can use this
               account, unless someone suspends it.</p>
            <p>If you forget your password you can reset it.  An email is sent to you with a code and a link. Either
               enter the code or follow the link to do the reset.</p>
            <p>For convenience we allow users to log in with Google or Facebook accounts.  In each case we grab
               the Email address, but no registration is required.  Its straightforward to add other OAuth 2 providers,
               in addition to Facebook.  Note that the token is invalidated as soon as we've read the Email address.
               This increases security, but its an odd use of OAuth.</p>
            <p>In practice all the URLs must run under <code>HTTPS</code>, since passwords are contained in the
               HTTP requests, and since we use Ajax calls where going from <code>HTTP</code> to <code>HTTPS</code>,
               which is cross-domain, is not allowed. This demo uses <code>HTTPS</code> throughout.

        <h1>How
            <small>we adapted Shiro</small>
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-2"></div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>The Shiro components which need to be adapted to App Engine are
                <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/realm.html">realms</a>,
                the <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/caching.html">cache</a> and
                the AOP-based annotations. If the annotations aren't required then
                they can be eliminated and startup time will be reduced.</p>
            <p>To create a new realm only two methods need to be implemented, namely:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
    AuthenticationInfo doGetAuthenticationInfo(AuthenticationToken token)
    AuthorizationInfo doGetAuthorizationInfo(PrincipalCollection principals)
</pre>
            <p>The only sort of token handle is the <code>UsernamePasswordToken</code>, so
               the principal and credentials are simple strings, in our case a user's email
               address and password. We use an email address as the user's identifier since we
               need it anyway to change passwords securely.</p>
            <p>It is possible to set up users in the <code>IniRealm</code> and it makes sense
               to use this with our new realm -- the <code>IniRealm</code> is a good place to stash
               the administrator login for example. Our <code>DatastoreRealm</code> needs to be able to
               store an unlimited number of users persistently, so we need the datastore for
               this. Rather than using the raw datastore service we use <a href="">Objectify</a> which
               is a well designed and  lightweight layer on top of the datastore, which just
               removes the rough edges without hiding the datastore structure.</p>
            <p>Implementation of the <code>DatastoreRealm</code> is via a user object, <code>GaeUser</code>,
                which is keyed on the email address and has a single indexed field - the registration date.
                Using the email as the key means that lookup will be fast and cheap.</p>
            <p>We have also implemented a Shiro-compatible cache, based on memcached.
                The cache expiry has been set to 5 minutes which should limit any consistency problems.</p>
            <p>Since the <code>DatastoreRealm</code> is a singleton in each JVM, and since although memcached
                saves on datastore resources it is slow, we also include an in-memory cache in the realm, which
                is of limited size and evicts after 5 minutes, but is fast. A combination of in-memory
                and memcached caches is the best way to limit hits to the data store and to minimize the
                overall cost and the number of instances we need,</p>
            <p>Another database object we use is a <code>RegistrationString</code>, which contains a one-shot code
                which is sent to users by email to allow them to (a) register and (b) change passwords. This code
                is time-limited so that archived emails don't cause a problem.</p>
            <p>The final database object is a counter to keep track of the number of users we have.  Its
               too inefficient to count users when the number is large so a counter is needed.  We don't expect
               the counter to be changed very often (not more than once a second) so there's no need for sharding.</p>

        </h1>

        <div class="col-md-2"></div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Its a lot easier for users if they don't have to go through the hassle of registration, and remember
               a password for yet another application. So, we've set things up to allow Google and Facebook login. The
               implementation is reasonably generic and can easily be extended to other providers, such as
               Yahoo!, LinkedIn and so on.  There is work involved I'm afraid as one needs to get credentials from each
               provider.  Also, you are restricted as to the website on which you can use any particular set of credentials.</p>

            <p>With Google  if you're already logged in with the browser, you will find that you don't get the opportunity
               to choose the account you want to use -- you're logged in immediately with the account you came with.
               Similarly there is no way to force re-authentication.</p>

            <p>We tried Google authentication with the built-in user service.  This didn't work very well either -- same
               problems, so it makes sense to use OAUth.  If you only need Google then we've left the code present and
               you wouldn't need to load the <code>scribe</code> library and hte OAuth adaption code.</p>

            <p>Facebook login, which uses OAuth, words  better. You always get to see the initial screen asking for permission,
               and you can force re-authentication.</p>

            <p>We had to make some additions to get
               <code>scribe</code> to work with Google and OAuth2, so some work may be necessary for other providers. The
               parameters you need are not the same in each case, and the return JSON is not uniform so has to be adapted
               for each provider.</p>

            <p>We're only considering services which provide a user email, on the principle that if some problem occurs
               with the provider we can still service these users by registering them in the normal way.  Of course people
               change their Emails, but in this case its one at a time, not a whole class at once, and for our applications
               not a huge issue.</p>

            <p>In an ideal world applications such as our would not need to do password management. Even though
                there are now a variety of identity providers, not all users will want to use them. So, as a
                fallback applications must provide <em>traditional</em> password management.</p>

            <p>This sample provides the basics packaged so that anyone working with App Engine can incorporate
                it relatively simply, although changes will be required to the front end code.</p>

            <p>In describing the flow we use relative URLs to describe processes controlled by servlets.</p>

            <h2>Control flow for registration</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the <code>/register.ftl</code> URL. This loads a page with a registration form.
                    The form contains an email field.
                </li>
                <li>The form is posted to <code>/register</code>. This is done using Ajax so we stay on the same
                    page. An email message is sent to the user at the provided address. The email contains a code
                    and a link. The user can either
                    enter the code and the desired password on the page or click the link in the sent email and
                    enter the code and password at the page which comes up.
                    In either case we post or get to the <code>/confirm</code> URL with the code as a parameter.
                <li>This checks the validity of the code, and if its valid
                    adds a confirmation message to the current page. The user is logged in on the server and
                    we are done.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Control flow for forgotten password</h2>

            <p>The control flow for a forgotten password is similar to that for registration with two slight
                differences.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If the email address is already registered we don't bail out with an error message, as the
                    presumption is that the person entering the data owns the email address.
                </li>
                <li>Some of the wording on the web pages is differed (Reset rather than Register). These
                    differences can be expressed using the same template configured with slightly different
                    arguments.

            <p>To provide a complete demo requires HTML pages.  We're using Bootstrap as the CSS framework.</p>
            <p>The HTML pages are organised using the Freemarker templating language. The <code>index.html</code>
               main page for example (this one) is pre-generated using Freemarker to avoid a wait while App Engine spins
               up an instance.  This uses the Maven plugin for <a href="http://fmpp.sourceforge.net/">FMPP</a>,
               the Freemarker pre-processor</p>
            <p>OAuth for the social login is done with <code>scribe</code> which makes a complicated process
               simple.  Heartily recommended.</p>
            <p>All the administrative logic is done using <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery's</a> Ajax
               features.  This is intended to decouple the login from the presentation if we wish to produce
               a mobile version of this demo, which will require different layouts.  We also do some caching in
               JavaScript to minimise round trips to the server to determine login status.  This doesn't compromise the
               server-side security but speeds things up and helps bring down App Engine's costs.</p>
            <h3>Reuse</h3>
            <p>The <code>com.cilogi.shiro.gae</code> package should
               be re-usable.  There are dependencies on Shiro, Objectify and Guava.  The Guava
               dependency could be removed with a some effort, Objectify somewhat more.</p>
            <p>The servlets in <code>com.cilogi.shiro.web</code> have parameters hard-wired and no
               I18N for strings, but the logic is re-usable.</p>
            <h3>Secrets</h3>
            <p>Note that to use Facebook you need to register a Web App with Facebook and put the keys in
              <code>src/main/resources/social.properties</code>.  The file will look something like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
fb.local.apiKey=*your key here*
fb.local.apiSecret=*your secret here*
fb.local.host=http://localhost:8080

fb.live.apiKey=*your key here*
fb.live.apiSecret=*your secret here*
fb.live.host=http://gaeshiro.appspot.com
</pre>
            <p>We find it useful to register two apps, one to run locally in the dev server, and one to
               run in production. Hence the <em>local</em> and <em>live</em> keys.</p>
